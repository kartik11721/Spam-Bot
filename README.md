# Spam-Bot
this program is used  to spam messages into any website or application

for this program you need to have python installed and a module called pyautogui.
to install the pyautogui module enter the following command into your terminal :

--> pip install pyautogui

after you run the program it will wait 5 seconds for the user to quicky change windows
and go to the application where they want the messages to be sent.
If you want to change the time required for the program to run, simply change
the value inside time.sleep()
eg time.sleep(5) , means a 5 second wait time.

The contents of the spam should be stored in the spam.txt file.
keep in mind that the program will press enter after every line 
in the spam.txt, so make sure that every seperate messge is in a new
line in spam.txt.

Enjoy ! :D
